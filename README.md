# MiraiBot

A Kotlin console project for Minecraft Server DripDrop, based on the based on open projrct mirai (High-performance bot
framework for Tencent QQ: https://github.com/mamoe/mirai)

This project can be compiled to a jar and run by commands. Users enter their QQ numbers and passwords (plaintext), then
the program connects to Tencent's servers and tries to log in.

The bot replies automatically to anyone who sends specific messages on QQ, no matter these messages are sent to her
directly, or just sent in a QQ group. For example, if someone wants to know what the IP address of your Minecraft server
is, and sends "#ip" to her or in a QQ group, she will reply the IP address such as "minecraft.com:1234".

Of course, if developers need more features, it is better to research
the [original project](https://github.com/mamoe/mirai) instead of just forking and modifying this project.
